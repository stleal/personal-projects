The Mission of St. Bridget Parish is to be a strong and vibrant Community of faith, a faith that is continuously nourished and strengthened by the celebration of the Eucharist. Realizing that we do not exist in isolation from the larger Framingham community, we participate in community endeavors, ecumenical programs, assist the needy by way of our Outreach Programs and extend a warm invitation to all those interested in exploring the truths of the Catholic faith.
