 * Description: 
 * 
 * Write a C# program “Running a lottery for migacents”, with a price of $4000.00: 
 * 
 *  Start with an empty bag. 
 *  Each ticket is represented by an integer, with its range being determined by the programmer. 
 *  One ticket number may be purchased multiple times. 
 *  For each ticket purchased, put an item in the bag. 
 *  Don't grab if not tickets purchased. 
 *  The odds should be determined before the sale. 
 *  The winning number should be randomly picked up in the number range announced before the sale. 
 *  Use a special number (e.g. –1) as the indication of the end of the sales. 
 *  The winner’s number should be announced, as well as the number of winners, and the price for each winner. If there is no winner, an announcement, which include the 
 *  message “the price will be roll over to next round”, should also be made. 
 *  
 * Please test your program to make sure that there are winners in some cases. Remember also to print the range of numbers and other information for the purchasers.
